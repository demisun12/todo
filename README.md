# todo
## About the Project
In this project, we'll be creating a Todo list application. The ‘todos’ are going to be objects that will be dynamically created, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them. Each item will have properties like titles, descriptions, etc. The application will have multiple projects or separate lists of todos, and will have to ability to create, delete, and edit them.
